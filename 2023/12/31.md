# December 31st, 2023

This wasn't a good week. I've been in a lot of pain. I think I'm going to skip a "year in review" sort of write up. I just don't have the energy. Might post my favorite music, movies, and games though.

I really want to have a better new year.

## Projects

### Macabre2D

I only made minor changes to Macabre2D this week to support Cosmic Jam.

### Cosmic Jam

I finished the first pass at a menu where you can change input bindings! Other than that, I did a lot of cleanup on how menus work.

### Comet Overdrive

I wrote a new riff for one of the songs I've been working on, but not much else. Back pain is getting in the way of my desire to play guitar.
