# Favorites 2023

Here's just some of my favorite things that have come out this past year. It's not a comprehensive or serious list, but it is the things I enjoyed the most!

## Games

1. The Talos Principle II
2. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
3. Blapshemous 2
4. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name
5. Moonstone Island
6. Marvel's Spider-Man 2
7. Super Mario Bros. Wonder
8. Street Fighter 6
9. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
10. Diablo IV

NOTE: I was not in the right headspace to play a large game like Baldur's Gate 3. I know I'm going to love it. There's a good chance it would sit at the top of my list. Divinity Original Sin 2 was my game of the year in the same year that Breath of the Wild released.
