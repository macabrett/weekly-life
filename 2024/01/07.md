I'm still going through it over here so not much of an update on my life. Feels like I've just been living through a painful blur.

## Projects

### Macabre2D

N/A

### Cosmic Jam

I think I've hammered down what I want the structure of Cosmic Jam to be. I'm not ready to talk about it yet, but I think I'll start prototyping some of the concepts this month.

### Comet Overdrive

Added two more potential songs to the album I'm working on. Originally, I had hoped to have this album finished sooner rather than later, but I'm enjoying taking my time with it and evolving the songs slowly. Hopefully sometime this year, I'll have music to share.
